Work in progress... be patient for the inital release.

To use this library you still need knowledge about the ADED contents 
or at least about the entities which you want to communicate. 
You still have to write converter classes from your data to a library 
internal structure following the rules described for the entity in the ADED. 

Library purposes:
- Read/Write ADIS formatted data files
- Receive/Send ISOagriNet formatted streams
- Interface for other programs which need to communicate through ADIS
This purpose will be moved to a new project in the future: 
- ADED Entity and Item library used for verification of received data

Supported line types:
D - Definition
V - Values
C - Comments
S - Search
R - Request
T - Termination
Z - EOF

Currently unsupported:
E - End
F - File
I - Include
O - Output

Supported line states:
N - Normal
F - Failure

Unsupported states:
H - Header
S - Sync
D - Delete

- da fuq? You've got still no clue what's this all about?
	Either you are wrong here or you just need more information to learn about it...
	More information (in German language!) at http://ian.lkv-nrw.de/index.php?id=308
	Resources are quite rare, I just currently do not know any resource about this subject in English, I'm sorry.
	Only if you want to spend some money to the ISO: http://www.techstreet.com/products/101643
